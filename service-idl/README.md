# service-idl
This project holds the definition of your service's public interface (The methods your service will expose to other clients and services).

## Instructions
Define the interface for your service using ProtoBuf IDL in the `src/main/proto` directory.

An example service interface has been provided for you: https://github.com/netifi/proteus-quickstart/blob/master/service-idl/src/main/proto/io/netifi/proteus/quickstart/service/protobuf/service.proto

## Documentation
Documentation on the IDL format can be found here: http://proteus-java.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
