# netifi-spring-quickstart
Source code for the [Netifi Spring Boot QuickStart](https://www.netifi.com/getstarted-springboot).

This project provides a scaffolding for getting up and running quickly with [Netifi](http://www.netifi.com/) on [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot).

The project comes with a simple client and service. The client sends the word `World` to the service and the service responds with the message `Hello, World! from {service name}`.

## Projects
This repo contains the following projects:

* [client](client) - Client that sends data to the service
* [service](service) - Service that responds to the client
* [service-idl](service-idl) - Definition of the API served by the service

## Prerequisites
The Netifi Spring QuickStart requires you have the following items installed on your machine:

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

## Getting Started
Follow the steps below to get a client and service communicating via the Netifi Broker in just a few short minutes.

1. In a new terminal window, pull the latest Netifi Broker Docker image by running the following command:

        docker pull netifi/broker:1.6.10
        
2. Next, run the following command to start the Netifi Broker:

        docker run \
        -p 7001:7001 \
        -p 8001:8001 \
        -p 8101:8101 \
        -e BROKER_SERVER_OPTS=" \
        '-Dnetifi.broker.ssl.disabled=true' \
        '-Dnetifi.authentication.0.accessKey=9007199254740991'  \
        '-Dnetifi.authentication.0.accessToken=kTBDVtfRBO4tHOnZzSyY5ym2kfY=' \
        '-Dnetifi.broker.admin.accessKey=9007199254740991' \
        '-Dnetifi.broker.admin.accessToken=kTBDVtfRBO4tHOnZzSyY5ym2kfY='" \
        netifi/broker:1.6.10

3. In a new terminal window, start the example quickstart service by running the following command:

        ./gradlew :service:bootRun

4. Next, in a new terminal window, start the example quickstart client by running the following command:

        ./gradlew :client:bootRun

5. If successful, the client will have sent the word, `World`, to the service and received the response `Hello, World! from SayHello`. You can verify this by checking the terminals for the following:

    In the service terminal you will see the following message:
    
        2018-09-03 14:16:39.561  INFO 46994 --- [actor-tcp-nio-6] i.n.p.q.service.DefaultHelloService      : received a message -> World

    In the client terminal you will see the following message:
    
        2018-09-03 14:16:39.571  INFO 46998 --- [           main] i.n.p.quickstart.client.ClientRunner     : message: "Hello, World! from SayHello"

Congratulations! You were able to get a Netifi Broker up and running and send a message between a client and a microservice.
